# Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis would allow me to see how user behavior has changed over time depending on when they signed up.

Currently I'm using Amplitude to track user behavior. I'm not sure how to use Amplitude to do the type of cohort analysis I want to do. I'm also not sure if Amplitude is the right tool for the job.

As of 2022-10-18, most months I've been averaging between 2 and 10 new users per week, or between 10 and 20 new users per month. I should probably start with a cohort size of 1 month.

## Analyses to Perform

### New Task in First Month

How likely are new users to create their first task month-over-month?

That is, how many new users create their first task in the first month they sign up? Compare by month.

| Month   | New Users | New Users Creating First Task | %   |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | --- |
| 2021-10 | 8         | 4                             | 50% |
| 2021-11 | 13        | 4                             | 31% |
| 2021-12 | 11        | 4                             | 36% |
| 2022-01 | 28        | 16                            | 57% |
| 2022-02 | 15        | 10                            | 67% |
| 2022-03 | 15        | 10                            | 67% |
| 2022-04 | 16        | 9                             | 56% |
| 2022-05 | 17        | 11                            | 65% |
| 2022-06 | 9         | 4                             | 44% |
| 2022-07 | 13        | 8                             | 62% |
| 2022-08 | 15        | 10                            | 67% |
| 2022-09 | 19        | 17                            | 89% |

These numbers seem very strong. I'm guessing there are other numbers that would be more important to push.
