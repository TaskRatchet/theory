# Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis would allow me to see how user behavior has changed over time depending on when they signed up.

Currently I'm using Amplitude to track user behavior. I'm not sure how to use Amplitude to do the type of cohort analysis I want to do. I'm also not sure if Amplitude is the right tool for the job.
