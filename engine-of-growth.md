# Engine of Growth

The engine of growth I'm attempting to use is the sticky engine. Key metrics for this engine, according to [The Lean Startup][1], are:

- Churn rate
- Usage frequency
- Consumer rention rate
- Acquisition rate

```
churn = departures / starting_users
usage_frequency = total_usage / starting_users
acquisition_rate = arrivals / starting_users
growth = (1 - churn) * usage_frequency * acquisition_rate
```

## Questions

- Why do users churn?
- What are our most effective acquisition channels?
- What's our churn rate?
