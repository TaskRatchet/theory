# Theory

## Risks

- The addressable market is too small to fully support myself financially.
- I develop features that fail to provide value to users.

## Assumptions

- I can build a product that provides value to users.
- The addressable market is enough to support myself financially. To make $1,500 / month, I'd need 3000 new tasks to be created per month on average. This is 100 tasks per day.

## Data Upgrades

- [Cohort analysis](./cohort-analysis.md)
- Split testing
- User interviews
- Lost user surveys
- Tracking prodcut-market fit

## Engine of Growth

The engine of growth I'm attempting to use is the sticky engine. Key metrics for this engine, according to [The Lean Startup][1], are:

- Churn rates
- Usage frequency
- Consumer rention rate
- Acquisition rate

## Questions

- How many users never create a task?
- What's my churn rate?
- What are my most effective acquisition channels?
- Why do users stop using TaskRatchet?
- What use cases do users use TaskRatchet to solve?
- What changes to TaskRatchet would create the most value for users?
