## Risks

- The addressable market is too small to fully support myself financially.
- I develop features that fail to provide value to users.

## Assumptions

- I can build a product that provides value to users.
- The addressable market is enough to support myself financially.

## Data Upgrades

- I need to have a way to do cohort analysis.
